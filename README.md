webcam-viewer

This is just for personal use for streams and stuff, as I didn't want to have to fiddle with other sources and most streaming apps and other things, seemed to be paid. So I am just using obs window capture for this and then https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/ for streaming back to applications that don't natively support any specific cameras.

You likely won't need this but if it works in apps like discord but doesn't show or crashes its a nice workaround.

Set obs to window capture and Capture Method to BitBlt to allow the option to not capture the cursor.
